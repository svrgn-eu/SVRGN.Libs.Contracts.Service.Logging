# About

This project provides some interfaces to implement an own logger. The idea is to have all of the implementation details in the class inheriting from ILogStrategy and combine different combinations of strategies in the ILogService implementation.

Also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern for the generic Design Pattern.
